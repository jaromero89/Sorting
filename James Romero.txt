* As the integers increased to respectable sizes the speeds went up as well
* Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort proves to process slowly in a limited time
* Merge Sort and Bubble Sort has shown relatively quick processing speeds to sort integer even when the values increased.  
* Merge Sort so crashed after an attempt to process a million integers
* I used a MacBook Pro 2018 for this test so a faster or slower computer may have changed the processing time.
